Things that can be fun:
  - Board Game rooms
  - Escape Rooms


Work
----
  - Sign up for email discussion lists
    - MSR list is pretty cool
    - internz is great for a timewaster
    - On a related note, outlook folders and rules are your friends.
  - Set up your workstation quickly, but it'll take a day or two.  Don't worry.
  - Be very proactive about meeting with your manager.  I expected too much hand-holding from my experience in school, and this (obviously) hurt me.
  - cc your manager, even if they're out of town.  My manager was out of town for well over half of my first 7 weeks of my internship; while he was out of office, I didn't send him emails (and just contacted my mentor instead), but this isn't a good choice.


Things not to do: Mention hella lit noms, you bae internz!
