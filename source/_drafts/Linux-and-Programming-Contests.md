For many programming contests at both the high school and collegiate levels,
participants are provided a computer to use for the duration of the competition.
Furthermore, CS departments being what they are, the computers they have on hand
tend to run a Unix-based operating system (like Linux or Mac); Windows computers
are far less common, if used at all.  This can be a problem for teams if they
are unfamiliar with Linux (especially the terminal interface).  In this blog
entry, I will outline some of the most important commands, as well as covering
some built-in utilities that can be helpful tools while writing solutions.
