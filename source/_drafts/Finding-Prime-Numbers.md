Primes are an interesting topic for both the mathematician and the computer scientist.  They have applications in cryptography, abstract algebra, and are an interesting subject of study in their own right.  In fact, the focus of many [Project Euler][1] problems involves properties of, or identities related to, prime numbers.  In this post, I aim to explain multiple ways of finding prime numbers.
