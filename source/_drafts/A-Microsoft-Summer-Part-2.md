In this, the second installment of my Microsoft Internship series ([part one][1]), I will focus on the logistics of interning.  Unlike the first part, this post will be fairly Microsoft-specific, rather than targeted towards the general "Seattle Intern."

Travel
------

**There and Back Again: An Expected Journey.**  If you live "far enough" away (which really isn't that far), Microsoft will pay for a two-way plane ticket to get you to Seattle and a small stipend for luggage fees or shipping boxes.  *I over-packed incredibly.*  I brought a suit, clothes for cold and warm weather, a bookshelf of books, some games, and a bunch of miscellaneous electronics equipment (like extra phone chargers, etc.) that I should have left behind.

Getting there and back again

While you're there
  - Car
  - Shuttle
  - Orca

Microsoft covers travel for their interns.

Travel:
  - Marriott Rewards (60k points + Gold Elite Status!)
  - Plane Miles (~3500 miles each way)
  - A car is nice; accidents are not

  - Everyone goes to Vancouver or Portland, and Leavenworth is pretty cool

Food
----

Eating:
  - Corporate housing probably has food of some kind.  Save money by eating their breakfasts
  - People who stay in hotels all had 3x-per week happy hour
  - MOD pizza!!


Living Arrangements 
-------------------

Living in Hotel:
  - George Foreman Grill for Chicken and Beef
  - Scrambled Eggs
