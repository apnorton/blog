To grow my programming repertoire, I decided to learn a functional language; at the recommendation of a friend, I selected [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell). Thus far, it seems great.  As a mathematician at heart, I love the way that the notation and language constructs resemble math (list comprehensions, tuples, function composition, etc).  In this blog post, I will outline the major resources I am using to learn Haskell.


To learn Haskell, I am using the ebook [*Learn You a Haskell for Great Good*](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters).  Yes--terrible grammar in the title, but it's (fairly) grammatically correct on the inside.  This is a great introduction to Haskell, although I'd highly recommend prior knowledge of another programming language like Java or C++.


Unfortunately, that ebook is somewhat lacking in practice problems.  It does have examples, but there isn't a true "exercise" section like one would find in a textbook.  This is a common fault with online programming tutorials; to be honest, creating a good exercise set is *hard* work.  To remedy this problem, I turned to a favorite site of mine, [HackerRank.com](http://www.hackerrank.com).  While designed for competitive programmers, this site also has an "introductory" set of functional programming challenges (see [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/categories/fp/intro)).  These range in difficulty from very easy to extremely hard.  This provides a great compliment to the tutorial I referenced above.


Finally, one last resource I am going to use after finishing *Learn You a Haskell* is a [set of lectures](http://shuklan.com/haskell/) by former University of Virginia student-teacher [Nishant Shukla](http://shukla.io/).  Although I have not been able to view them in great detail, they appear to present a great introduction to Haskell.
