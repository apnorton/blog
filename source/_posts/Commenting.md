Thanks to a [helpful blog post][1] by CodeBlocQ, I've now enabled Disqus-powered comments on the blog!  Let me know what you think about my posts, and I'll keep an eye on discussions to respond to questions/comments/concerns!

The second part of the Microsoft series should be out soon; I wanted to get comments working before I did so, but it took me a while to find the time to actually get it up and running.
