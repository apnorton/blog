I am an avid member of the [Math.StackExchange](http://math.stackexchange.com) community.  We have recently reached a milestone, as our request to create a site blog has been approved by the Stack Exchange administration. I volunteered to write a post which I believe should be useful to competition programmers.


Using Green's Theorem, [this post](http://math.blogoverflow.com/2014/06/04/greens-theorem-and-area-of-polygons/) derives a formula for the area of any simple polygon, dependent solely on the coordinates of the vertices.  This is useful for some computational geometry problems in programming; for example, the formula can be used to compute the area of the [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of a set of points.
